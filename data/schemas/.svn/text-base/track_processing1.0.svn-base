		object with which it is found.  E.g., in arrival - arrival
		time; in origin - origin time; in wfdisc, - start time of
		data.  Where date of historical events is known, time is
		set to the start time of that date; where the date of
		contemporary arrival measurements is known but no time is
		given, then the time attribute is set to the NA value. 
		The double-precision floating point number allows 15
		decimal digits.  At 1 millisecond accuracy this is a range
		of 3 years.  Where time is unknown, or prior to Feb.  10,
		1653, set to the NA value.

	Fields (  time endtime analyst checkout checkin qcanalyst qc cnss neic dir dfile dbsource )
	Primary (  time::endtime )
	Detail {
		This relation tracks analysis of individual
		time-periods of data, usually day-volumes.  The analyst
		who checks out the day-volume for processing is
		recorded, along with the checkout and checkin times.
		The quality-control stage is recorded when complete.
		dir and dfile specify the database pathname into which
		an analyst checks out a time-period for analysis. This
		allows other programs to spy on progress when
		necessary, presuming the database doesn't move during
		analysis.
