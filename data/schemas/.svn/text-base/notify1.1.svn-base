	Format ( "%-30s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Professional Association or Title of individual" )
	Detail { 
		This field is intended to give an impression of the role
		the individual plays in the large-earthquake response 
		process, either as a key decision maker (e.g. State
		Seismologist), interested party (e.g. geophysics professor),

		letter, then a number with no spaces. e.g. A1 is
		top priority. A-class priority levels are before B-class
		priority levels. All names in the same priority 
		class will be treated in an implementation-dependent 
		manner.

	String ( 1 )
	Format ( "%-1s" ) 
	Null  ( "n"  ) 
	Description ( "notification upon damage" )

	Null  ( "n" )
	Description ( "notification upon frequent calls" )

Attribute vertex
	Integer ( 8 )
	Format ( "%8d" ) 
	Null  ( "0" )
	Range( "vertex > 0" )
	Description ( "Sequence number of vertex specifying region" )
	Detail {
		The vertices for a polygon are listed in order, clockwise
		around a region. The vertex field specifies the sequence
		number of each vertex for a given region, e.g. first,
		second, third, etc.
	}
	;

Attribute lat 
	Real ( 9 )
	Format ( "%9.4lf" ) 
	Units ( "Degrees" ) 
	Range ( "lat >= -90.0 && lat <= 90.0" ) 
	Null  ( "-999.0"  )

Relation contact
	Fields (
		name priority role work_ph home_ph email note lddate
		)

	Primary ( name )
	Description ( "How to get ahold of the party" )
	;

Relation threshold
	Fields (
		name regname minmag maxz damage freq_calls lddate
		)
	Primary ( name regname minmag )
	Description ( "Conditions under which to notify party" )
	Detail {
		This table specifies the conditions under which 
		to notify a given party. A party of a given name may
		have multiple entries, for one or more regions of interest.
		A match on any row triggers notification of that party.
		The minmag field is a primary key, in order to allow
		multiple entries for a person for the same region: e.g.
		Anchorage mag > 5 and depth < 50 km, plus any depth earthquake
		in Anchorage of mag > 7. The damage and frequent-calls 
		fields override the minimum magnitude and depth criteria, 
		i.e. checking them off, in the example given, would mean
		Anchorage mag > 7, OR damaging, OR with frequent calls. 
	}
	;

Relation regions
	Fields (
		regname vertex lat lon
		)
	Primary ( regname vertex )
	Description ( "Vertices defining regions of interest" )
	Detail {
		This table specifies the vertex locations for the 
		polygons enclosing each region. The vertex field
		indicates the ordering of the vertices around the 
		polygon. For implementations which need to 
		distinguish unambiguously the difference between the 
		inside and outside of a region, usually for regions
		that include significant fractions of the globe or regions
		that might be on the far side of the globe from a 
		possibly included earthquake, the vertices should 
		be listed in clockwise order looking down at the 
		surface in map view.
