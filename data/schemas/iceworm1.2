Include css3.0

Schema iceworm1.2
	Description ( "Iceworm Schema Version 1.0 " )
	Detail {
		This schema is an expansion of the css3.0 schema for use
		with the Iceworm system. The databases produced by Iceworm
		for external consumption are intended to be in strict 
		css3.0 format. The additions to css3.0 represented by the
		iceworm schema are designed to help the iceworm system 
		manage internal details, and are intended to be invisible
		to the end user. 
		Modifications:
		1) 8/96 split pins table into pins, ewanalog, picker tables
		2) 9/96 added parameters to picker table for rex-allen picker
		3) 9/96 added timecorr table for shifting raw waveform data
		4) 11/96 added win table for Japanese stations
		5) 2/97 added field n1 to picker table
		6) 8/97 added reftekchan and reftekdas tables

Attribute active
	Integer (10)
	Format ( "%10d" )
	Null ( "0" )
	Range ( "active == 0 || active == 1" )
	Description ( "active describes whether a station should be used" )
	Detail {
		The field "active" is 1 if a station should be used
		in calculation. For example in the eva table an entry 
		in this field can be used to turn stations on or off
		while leaving their information in the database.

Attribute adchan
	Integer (5)
	Format ( "%5d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "adchan >= 0" )
	Description ( "Channel number on a given A/D converter" )
	Detail {
		This indicates which channel on a given A/D unit is
		handling this data stream. The acquisition board 
		digitizes the incoming data and puts the digital 
		data sequentially in memory. For multiplexed data,
		the digitized data is therefore a sequence in memory
		of the different multiplexer inputs. The A/D 
		channel numbers in the adchan field reflect the
		sequence in which incoming data is digitized, i.e. 
		the same as the sequence in which the multiplexer
		scans across its data inputs. On the National brand
		acquisition board, model AT-MIO-16F-5, this scan 
		sequence is given by the following formula, 
		assuming four multiplexer boards:
		(boardchan-boardchan%4)*4+(muxboard-1)*4+boardchan%4,
		where % indicates modulo division.

	Detail {
		This indicates which channel on a given demultiplexer
		board on a given A/D unit is handling this data stream.
		The physical terminals on each demultiplexer board have 
		numbers painted next to them--this is the same number.
		On the AMUX-64T Multiplexer boards, each of which has
		64 channels, the numbers go from 0-63.

        Description ( "multi-station triggering duration in seconds" )
        Detail {
                mstrigsec defines the minimum number of seconds a station
                has to be above the corresponding threshold level
                (mstrigthresh) in order for that station to contribute
                along with other stations in its network to a
                multi-station EVA alarm
        }

Attribute mstrigthresh
	Real (12)

	Null ( "-1.000" )
	Range ( "mstrigthresh > 0" )
	Description ( "multi-station triggering threshold" )
	Detail {
		mstrigthresh defines the threshold amplitude of the

Attribute pinno
	Integer (5)
	Format ( "%5d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "pinno >= 0" )
	Description ( "Earthworm Pin number" )
	Detail {
		The pin number is an arbitrary "social security number" 
		of a data stream in the Iceworm A/D conversion process.
		This number is unique to an installation, so if there
		are multiple A/D converters running at one site, pin
		numbers must be coordinated between them to avoid 
		overlap. pinno and chanid are somewhat redundant. Pinno
		has the advantage of privacy to the earthworm system 
		and historical compatibility.

		seismic system (i.e. network), and the second two
		characters (lower byte) represent the channel.

Relation eva
	Fields (  sta chan net active sstrigsec sstrigthresh mstrigsec mstrigthresh )

	Description ( "parameters for Alaskan EVA alarm" )
	Detail {
		The entries in this table define the parameters for the
		EVA alarm stations in Iceworm's digital re-cast of the
		Earthquake-Volcano-Alarm. Pin numbers
		are deliberately omitted from this table to enforce
		consistency of pin-number to station-channel-name 
		assignments. One station-channel can be entered for 
		several networks, if it contributes to the triggering
		of different networks in different ways. Values for 
		the single-station triggers should be entered only
		once if multiple rows are listed for a given station.

Relation ewanalog
	Fields (  sta chan discno admod adchan muxboard boardchan )
	Primary (  adchan )
	Description ( "Wiring Information for data from Earthworm A-to-D converter" )
	Detail {
		This table contains information on physical wiring of analog
		stations being digitized by the Earthworm Analog to Digital converter.
		The "discno" field allows this information to be connected
		to information on how the discriminators are wired to the 
		Earthworm A/D in Fairbanks. The "ew" prefix in the name of this 
		table is intended to specify the digitizer constructed by the 
		Menlo Park Earthworm team. Other digitizing strategies and hardware
		may require a different table. Note that the relationship 
		between discno and admod/adchan/muxboard/boardchan should 
		be left untouched unless physical wiring at the A/D box is 
		changed. Under normal day-to-day operations, sta-chan fields
		should be changed to reflect changing assignments of discriminators. 
		Sta and Chan are deliberately left out of the join keys, i.e.
		any join of this table with another must be a theta join. Full 
		justification for this engineering decision is described elsewhere.

Relation timecorr
	Fields (  sta chan time endtime commdelay )
	Primary (  sta chan time::endtime )
	Description ( "Time shifts to apply to raw waveform data" )
	Detail {
		Timecorr describes the time shifts to apply to the raw
		data streams coming into the Iceworm system. Currently 
		there is only one field to use to modifiy the data,
		commdelay. In the Iceworm system, this correction must 
		happen before data reach the TRACE_RING, usually when
		trace-packets are being built. 
		After application of this correction the waveforms will
		be timestamped with the real UTC time to which the earth
		motion corresponds.
