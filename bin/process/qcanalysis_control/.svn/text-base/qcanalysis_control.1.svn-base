.SH NAME
qcanalysis_control \- database checkout/checkin utility for QCing (Quality Control) of processed data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBqcanalysis_control \fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBqcanalysis_control\fP utility is a graphical tool for managing QCing of processed
data by QC seismologists. The utility allows
seismologist to check out a database that no one else is working on, and check
it back into the system when done. Several tasks are performed
after data is checked in, launched by this tool. Original analyzed databases are moved to /Seis/processing/analyzed/YEAR_MO/db_daily; QCed databases are copied to /Seis/processing/analyzed/YEAR_MO; summary QC database is updated; an evolving database for the whole month is created (/Seis/processing/analyzed/YEAR_MO/analyzed_YEAR_MO_evolving); /Seis/processing/analyzed/YEAR_MO/cnss_YEAR_MO file is created for submission to cnss catalog (actual submissions needs to be done later by seismologist).

The \fBqcanalysis_control\fP script will not allow a database to be checked in if
there are no rows in it.
