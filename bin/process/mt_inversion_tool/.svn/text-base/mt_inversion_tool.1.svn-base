.SH NAME
\fBmt_inversion_tool\fR \-  Graphical driver for moment tensor inversion using D.Dreger's TDMT inversion code (Time-Domain Moment Tensor INVerse Code). 
.SH SYNOPSIS
mt_inversion_tool [dbname] [orid]
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
where:
.LP
dbname - database name with the origin parameters, origin and event tables are required. This argument is optional.
.LP
orid - origin number of event for which inversion is to be calculated. This argument is optional.
.LP
Alternatively, both arguments can be entered interactively throught mt_inversion_tool. If there is only one parameter in the command line, it is assumed to be the database name.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmt_inversion_tool\fR is a graphical-user-interface driver for D.Dreger's TDMT inversion code.
It is intended to assist AEIC analysts with moment tensor inversion.

The graphical interface contains a number of dialog boxes and action buttons. 

Top panel dialog boxes:

database - allows user to enter database name with the event information;

origin - allows user to enter origin number (orid) of an event for which inversion will be performed.

Left column buttons:

Button 1 - open db with earthquake info - \fBdbe\fR is called with the path provided in the \fBdatabase\fR entry field.

Button 2 - extract waveforms - creates event directory and extracts waveforms using trexcerpt program. If event directory already exists, checks for old waveform files and prompts user whether to delete or save the old files. Next, db2sac is called to convert extracted waveforms into sac format. 

Button 3 - check waveforms - calls dbe to open wfdisc table with the extcacted waveforms. 

Button 4 - update origin parameters - creates or updates file with the event info for later use by the inversion program.

Button 5 - run inversion for all depths (tdmt_redi_sched) - executes main script tdmt_redi_sched to run the moment tensor inversion. 

Button 6 - run inversion for single depth (tdmt_invc) - executes tdmt_invc to run inversion for a single depth given in "depth for tdmt_invc" dialog box.  

Button 7 - depth vs goodness of fit graph - creates plot to evaluate quality of the solution.

Button 8 - make maps - creates map with beach ball and event location for the web update.

Button 9 - update website - copies files for webpage display.

Button 10 - update moment table - updates moment table of the main input database.

Button 11 - print waveforms - prints plot with the waveform fit and inversion results.

Button 12 - print map - prints map.

Button 13 - send a problem report - opens window for sending the problem report.

Right column:

waveforms - there are 3 options: op, bak, and mig. This is location of the waveform archive from which the waveform segments will be exctracted for the inversion;

minimum distance - minimum distance for stations in the inversion;

maximum distance - maximum distance for stations in the inversion;

max # of stations - maximum number of stations in the inversion;

allow isotropic - if "no", a standard TDMT code is executed with no isotropic component allowed; if "yes", a special inversion code is executed to allow for isotropic component, this code is not fully developed at the moment.

velocity model - allows to choose velocity model for synthetics. Currently the options include: scak - recommended for deeper events and south-central Alaska; tactN - recommended for crustal events and/or events north of the Denali Fault; aleut - recommended for the Aleutians. "auto" option passes selection decision to the program.

depth for tdmt_invc - value for the single depth inversion. It has to be executed after "run inversion for all depths (tdmt_redi_sched)" has been performed, otherwise this option will not work. If the depth is not one of those produced by tdmt_redi_sched, user will be given a list of available depths.


Bottom panel:

Buttons 1, 2, 3 - minimize, maximize, or create output window. 

Button 4 - Quit - quits mt_inversion_tool. 

.SH FILES
wfdisc table and seed and sac waveform files are created after "extract waveforms" option;
the rest of the files are created by tdmt_redi_sched and are used for the plots, web site and database updates. Read TDMT documentation for detailed description.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
mt_inversion_tool expects the ANTELOPE environment variable to be set correctly.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
mt_inversion_tool expects parameter file mt_inversion_tool.pf.
