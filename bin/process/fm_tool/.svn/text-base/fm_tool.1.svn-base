.SH NAME
\fBfm_tool\fR \-  Graphical driver to calculate P-wave first motion focal mechanisms. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
fm_tool [dbname] [orid]
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
where:
.LP
dbname - database name with origin and arrivals. This argument is optional.
.LP
orid - origin number of event for which focal mechanism is to be calculated. This argument is optional.
.LP
Alternatively, both arguments can be entered interactively throught fm_tool. If there is only one parameter in the command line, it is assumed to be the database name.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfm_tool\fR is a graphical-user-interface driver for dbfpfit.
It is intended to assist AEIC analysts in calculating P-wave first motion focal mechanisms.

The graphical interface contains 2 dialog boxes and 13 colored buttons. The dialog boxes allow
the user to enter database name and orid of an event for which focal mechanism is to be calculated. The buttons are described in descending order.

Left column:

Button 1 - open database - \fBdbe\fR is called with the path provided in \fBdatabase\fR entry field.

Button 2 - save new db - selects origin, assoc, and arrival records from input \fBdatabase\fR for given \fBorid\fR and saves it as a new database in directory provided as \fBdata_path\fR in the parameter file. 
The subset database is called dbYRMODAHOMISE.

Button 3 - open dbpick - starts \fBsmartpick_classic\fR with saved subset database. This is to provide means to pick and/or correct first motions.

Button 4 - calculate focal mechanism - calls \fBdbfpfit\fR and calculates focal mechanism. 

Button 5 - view results - runs \fBfpplot\fR to generate postscript file with the final focal mechanism and shows it with \fBghostview\fR option.

Button 6 - update fplane table - writes results into fplane table of the database provided in \fBdatabase\fR entry field. 

Button 7 - print results - sends beach ball plot to default printer.  

Right column:

Top panel - gives an option of selecting system for the waveform display.

Button 1 - gedit parameter file - change option in parameter file for dbfpfit. 

Button 2 - send problem report - send e-mail to maintainer of the tool. 

Buttons 3, 4, 5 - minimize, maximize, or create output window. 

Button 6 - Quit - quits fm_tool. 

.SH FILES
See dbfpfit for descrition of the output files.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
fm_tool expects the ANTELOPE environment variable to be set correctly.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
fm_tool expects parameter file fm_tool.pf.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
By default, waveforms are assumed to be located in /iwrun/[op,bak,mig]/run/db/archive/archive_YEAR_MO_DA. To change this setting, you can edit descriptor file of your saved subset database or change descr_temlp parameter in fm_tool.pf. Path to where it is saved is given in data_path parameter in fm_tool.pf parameter file.
