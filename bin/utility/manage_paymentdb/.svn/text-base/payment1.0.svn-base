Schema Payment1.0
	Description ( "Schema for tracking payments in a bill-paying collective" )
	Detail {
		This schema tracks payment administration in a bill-paying collective, such as an office pool for a water cooler. It assumes one person is responsible for paying the vendor bills, and dividing responsibility for those bills up amongst the various people. All payments from party members to the administrator are logged. A balance table shows the net obligation of each member of the pool. The balance table summarizes information from the other tables, and thus should be updated through a software interface rather than direct editing.
