.SH DESCRIPTION
project_ellipse takes a three-dimensional error ellipse and projects
it onto the surface of the earth. Specified on the command line
are the azimuths and dips (degrees) for two of the axes; the corresponding
standard errors; and the standard error along the third axis.

.nf
Four quantities are printed to standard-out:
	The standard error along the major axis;
	The standard error along the minor axis;
	The standard error in depth;
	The strike of the major axis.
(In that order.)
