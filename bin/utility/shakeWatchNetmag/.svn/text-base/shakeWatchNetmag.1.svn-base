.SH NAME
.nf
shakeWatchNetmag -  watch an Antelope netmag table for new rows, and call the USGS ShakeMap 
if an origin is eligible
.fi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
shakeWatchNetmag [-p pf]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBshakeWatchNetmag\fP periodically checks an Antelope netmag table and processes any
new rows. The netmag row may not correspond to a prefor, and there can be multiple netmag
rows for each origin. So the program examines all netmag rows for a particular origin,
and if this is a prefor, it grabs the most recent values for Mw, Ms, Ml and Mb for that prefor.
The magnitude to use for a ShakeMap is determined by the order Mw, Ms, Ml and Mb.
.IP
The status of this event in the ShakeMap system is determined, e.g. does a ShakeMap already exist
for this event? The eligibility of the origin is then determined. A series of checks then
takes places, which either lead to nothing happening, a new ShakeMap being generated (if the
origin is eligible), or an existing ShakeMap (corresponding to an earlier origin for this event)
being cancelled.
.IP
Any manual cancellation messages are also processed. This simply requires a user to 'touch $evid.cancel'
(where $evid is the corresponding event id) in the appropriate directory.  
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pf"
Specifies the path of the parameter file to be used. If omitted, defaults to pf/shakeWatchNetmag.pf.
.SH "PARAMETER FILE"
.IP run_home
Directory path to rtexec.pf, e.g. /home/shake/run
.IP bin_home
Directory path to USGS ShakeMap executable 'shake', e.g. /usr/local/ShakeMap/bin
.IP database
The event database to watch
.IP second_polygon
0 or 1, indicating whether a second polygon is defined as part of the magnitude criteria
.IP auto_cancel
A boolean flag to indicate whether automatic cancellation of shakemaps is off(0) or on (1)
.IP minmax
Array (Hash) of different criteria, keys are nass_min, mmi_min, norids_max
e.g.
minmax &Arr{
nass_min	10
mmi_min		2.0
norids_max	200
}
.IP minmag_polygon1
The minimum magnitude for an event in polygon1 that will be considered for a ShakeMap
.IP polygon1
Table (List) of different latitude,longitude coordinates specifying a polygon
e.g.
polygon1 &Tbl{
 	50,-135
 	75,-135
 	75,-170
	55,-170
	55,-180
	50,-180
}
.IP minmag_polygon2
As for minmag_polygon1
.IP polygon2
As for polygon1
.IP mag_buffer
Obsolete if auto_cancel = 0
It is not necessarily desirable to cancel a ShakeMap if the magnitude falls just below the normal magnitude threshold.
If mag_buffer is set, when considering whether to cancel a ShakeMap, a magnitude threshold of minmag_polygon1 - mag_buffer will be used.
e.g. if mag_buffer = 0.5, and minmag_polygon=5.0, then to cancel an existing ShakeMap its magnitude must fall below 4.5
.IP cancelmsgdir
This is the directory shakeWatchNetmag examines for any requests to cancel a ShakeMap manually. It looks for a file of the name $evid.cancel.
The file contents are ignored, so creating a cancel request with 'touch' will suffice.
.IP author_list
Array (Hash) of different authors and their priority
e.g.
author_list &Arr{
oa_bk		1 
oa_op		1
wcatwc 		2 
neic 		3 
UAF 		4 
manual 		5
}
