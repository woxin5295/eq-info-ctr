.SH NAME
.nf
parseShakemapArchive - download a ShakeMap for an event and convert it to gif format
.fi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
parseShakemapArchive [-p parameter_file] YEAR [evid evtime ShakeMapDir]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBparseShakemapArchive\fP logs on to ShakeMap webpage and downloads the Shakemap Archive webpage for the given year. If event information is provided, the archive webpage is parsed to see if there is a live ShakeMap for this event. If there is, the corresponding ShakeMap image file is downloaded. For compatibility with dbevents_aeic which is a Tcl/Tk program, the image file is converted from JPEG to GIF (Tcl/Tk cannot display JPEG images). This is saved to ShakeMapDir.
.LP
The event information given should be an evid (event id) and evtime (event time). If evid is not matched, evtime will be matched.
.SH OPTIONS

.IP evtime 
if evid is not found, match this event time instead (in case databases have different ids)
