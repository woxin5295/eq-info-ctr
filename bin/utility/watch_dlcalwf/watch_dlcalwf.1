.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwatch_dlcalwf\fP watches a dlcalwf table, and when a new row is created, 
it tries to find the first matching calibration sequence for that station, channel and duration.
It then calls dbcalibrateWrapper, which compares those two calibration sequences. 
Finally it calls displayscal_aeic to produce a postscript file, which is converted to PDF.
The internal webpage link "station autocalibrations" is an interface to these PDF files.
