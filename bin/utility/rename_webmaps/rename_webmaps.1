.TH DBRECENTEQS_AEIC_4.6 1 2007/11/12 "Glenn Thompson, AEIC" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
.nf
rename_webmaps - rename webmaps generated with dbrecenteqs4 from $evid.gif to $evtime.gif, and post them to the EOC orbserver.fi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
rename_webmaps inputdir webmapdir xferdir
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrename_webmaps\fP is used to send webmap gifs, created with dbrecenteqs, to the iMacs for the EOC project. The problem is that an event in the event database on an iMac will have a different to the same event in the summary database at AEIC. Therefore, a copy of the webmap has to be made using the event time (down to 1 thousandth of a second) as part of the filename, rather than event id. This webmap file is posted to a directory watched by orbxfer2 on the EOC orbserver, from where it gets transfered as a special packet. It is then pulled off the orb by orbxfer2 on the iMac, and made available for plotting with dbevents_aeic.
.PP
Another solution would be just to run dbrecenteqs locally. However, dbrecenteqs requires the installation of many third-party softwares, and so is far from ideal.
.SH "COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS"
.IP inputdir
The directory under which dbrecenteqs makes its evid directories.
.IP webmapdir
The directory (not necessarily on a web server) where renamed gifs and touch files will be stored (they are automatically deleted after a few days).
.IP xferdir
The directory to put another copy of the renamed webmap gifs for orb2orb transfer (using the orbxfer2 program).
