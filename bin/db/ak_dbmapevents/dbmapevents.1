.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dbmapevents
will make a map of events and stations from a v. 3.0 CSS database.
A detailed worldwide cartography database is used to provide coastlines,
shorelines, rivers and political boundaries. The level of cartographic
detail is determined by the size of the map region. Maps are always drawn
using an equal distance projection with an origin that is determined
either by a station location (from the \fBsite\fP table), a hypocenter
(from the \fBorigin\fP table) or a user specified latitude-longitude
coordinate. The events are always taken from the \fBorigin\fP table and
can be optionally sifted and color-symbol coded by the \fBauthor\fP field
within the \fBorigin\fP table. An interactive mode can be optionally
enabled that allows the user to pan and zoom the map after it is initially
drawn. PostScirpt versions of the map are put into a file named
dbmapevents.ps.
.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
\fIdbname\fP
The name of the subject database. The database name is defined as the
file name of one of the flat relation files without the .relname suffix.
For example, if the .wfdisc relation file name is ./foo.wfdisc then ./foo
is the database name.
This argument is required.
.TP 15
\fIsta | orid | lat:lon\fP
A coordinate origin definition. If a valid station code is specified, then
the latitude-longitude of that station is used as the origin. If a valid
\fBorid\fP value is specified, then the hypocenter latitude-longitude
for that \fBorid\fP is used. If a latitude:longitude value is specified
(with a : separating the two values), then that value is used. Latitudes
and longitudes are specified in degrees with +/- values representing
north and south latitudes, respectively, and east and west longitudes.
This argument is required.
.TP 15
\fIrange\fP
The map plot range in degrees from the origin to the edges of the map.
This argument is required.
.TP 15
\fI-c\fP
If specified, then enter interactive mode after making the map. During
interactive mode, a cross-hairs cursor appears in the plot window and
can be manipulated with the mouse. If this argument is not specified,
then the program will exit immediately after making the map.
.TP 15
\fIauth1 sym1 hue1 lit1 sat1 ...\fP
An optional list of hypocenter author sifting keys and color-plotting
symbol codes for each author. Each element in the list consists of
\fIauth#\fP which specifies an \fBauthor\fP field within the \fBorigin\fP
table, \fIsym#\fP, which specifies a plotting symbol and should be
one of 'box', 'triangle', 'hexagon', or 'cross', \fIhue#\fP, which specifies
the symbol color hue value (0.0 to 360.0), \fIlit#\fP, which specifies
the symbol color lightness value (0.0 to 1.0), and \fIsat#\fP, which specifies
the symbol color saturation value. If no author sifting keys are given, then
all hypocenters are plotted with the same symbol and color.
.SH PROGRAM INTERACTION
If the \fI-c\fP command line argument has been specified, then a cross-hair
cursor will appear in the map area and the program will go into an
interactive mode (after the initial map is made). Single key commands
can then be typed while the cursor cross-hair is active.
Single key commands are defined as follows (no RETURN is required):
.br
\fB?\fP - Display help menu.
.br
\fBq\fP - Quit and leave the window on the screen.
.br
\fBQ\fP - Quit and destroy the window.
.br
\fBp\fP - Pan.
.br
\fBi\fP - Zoom in by a small increment.
.br
\fBI\fP - Zoom in by a large increment.
.br
\fBo\fP - Zoom out by a small increment.
.br
\fBO\fP - Zoom out by a large increment.
.br
\fBe\fP - Identify closest event.
.br
\fBs\fP - Identify closest station.
.br
\fBt\fP - Enter time range.
.br
\fB1\fP - Toggle orid labels on/off.
.br
\fB2\fP - Toggle depth symbol color coding on/off.
.br
\fB3\fP - Toggle shallow depth symbol color coding on/off.
.br
\fB4\fP - Toggle depth residual symbol color coding on/off.
.br
\fB5\fP - Toggle station symbols on/off.
.br
\fB6\fP - Toggle color coding of events in the PDE catalog on/off.
.br
\fB7\fP - Toggle magnitude symbol size coding on/off.
.br
\fB8\fP - Toggle display of distance circles on/off.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The cartography file must be resident at $JSPC/data/maps/mapdata. The JSPC
environment varibale must be set appropriately. In addition the SCHEMA_DIR
environment variable can be used (see jspcenv(5)).
