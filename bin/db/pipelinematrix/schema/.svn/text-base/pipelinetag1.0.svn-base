	Integer (1)
	Format ( "%1d" )
	Range ( "p_test > -1 && p_test < 2" )
	Description ( "Test in progress" )
	Detail {
		This test bit will be set if an artificial signal 
		input such as calibration or other test signals	are applied.

		pump station sensors has no fault condition and station
		is online. If a system fault is detected, the p_status 
		will be set to 0. For example, if sensor latency, gps clock latency,
		sensor voltage, or some other criteria  exceeds a specified 
		cutoff p_status is set to 0.
