.SH NAME
dberrchk \- reviews an event database for a series of possible errors
and reports them to the user.
.SH SYNOPSIS
dberrchk dbin
.LP
where:
.LP
dbin = input database
.SH DESCRIPTION
dberrchk is intended to assist the AEIC analyst
in preparing a daily, weekly or monthly event database
by reviewing all solutions and reporting on possible errors.

dberrchk is similar to catalog, however it is intended
to run on a Antelope Datascope database rather than pickfiles.
dberrchk assumes that the input database (dbin) includes at least
one earthquake. dberrchk will check all events for
a number of possible errors and produce a report to the window from
which it was called and to an output file.

The report dberrchk produces includes:
A breif summary line that indicates the orid, location algorithm, 
model and analyst.
The report includes: Origin time, location, geographic region, 
standard error of the P and S picks, and a quality assesment of the 
earthquake location (A, B, C, D).
dberrchk warns if standard error of the P and S picks is larger
than 1.0, if seismic gap is greater than 180, and if location error is too large (smajax>=20 or sdepth>=30). dberrchk also
warns the user if a deep event is located outside of the WBZ (north 
of 64N or west of 150W or east of 145W or in the Gulf).
It reports if the number of P picks is less than 10 or S picks is 
less than 3. It lists stations with large travel time residuals. It 
checks for magnitude range and reports if it is larger than 1.5. It 
lists stations with magnitude residuals greater than 0.75. This is 
intended to assist the analyst in locating problematic stations that 
may bias the magnitude. 

Use dbchecker for suggestions for additional stations to pick that 
may reduce the seismic gap and improve the location quality.

dberrchk automatically fixes the assoc table if the delta and esaz
fields are missing. dberrchk also warns the user if the event is a 
possible duplicate and if no magnitude was calculated.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "dbin"
The input database name. This argument is required.
.SH FILES
The error report is output to the file dberrchk.err. dberrchk will
report on each event in dbin. An example is shown below.
