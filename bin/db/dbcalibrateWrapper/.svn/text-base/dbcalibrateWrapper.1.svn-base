.SH NAME
dbcalibrateWrapper \- a helpful wrapper script for dbcalibrate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbcalibrateWrapper dbin dbtemp calseq calseqcomp
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbcalibrateWrapper\fP is a wrapper script for calling dbcalibrate. It's main purpose
is to construct a temporary database which includes a wfdisc table built from the
AEIC continuous waveform archive databases, relevant for the calibration sequence(s)
requested.

.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.IP DBIN
	The input database, which must containing a dlcalwf table.
.IP DBTEMP
	The temporary database, which will be created prior to dbcalibrate being called, and removed afterwards.
.IP CALSEQ
	The calibration sequence we want to examine.
.IP CALSEQCOMP
	The calibration sequence we want to compare against, to examine relative changes in spectra.
.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf

Change to the correct directory:
> cd /net/inverse/export/inverse/fema/run_calibrate

Examine the calwf table, and select a calibration sequence of interest, and a comparison calibration sequence:
> dbe dbpipe/pipeline_stations.dlcalwf

Run dbcalibrateWrapper on the calibration sequences chosen. In the following case, we will compare the response
for station PS06 on November 6th, with one computed about 43 hours earlier on November 5th:
> dbcalibrateWrapper dbpipe/pipeline_stations db/tempdb PS_PS06-2008311:22:10:12 PS_PS06-2008310:03:00:11

After running this, you will probably want to run DISPLAYSCAL.
