.SH NAME
mapset \- GUI front-end to the Alaskan dbmapevents program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBmapset \fP[\fIdbname\fP]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Mapset is a graphical user interface to the Alaskan version of the dbmapevents
program, the original version of which was written at the JSPC. Mapset
allows customizable macros for frequently-used map settings; pre-formatted
packages of labels that can be specified by users and/or installation
managers; pre-formatted boilerplates to incorporate descriptive text and/or
bitmap logos; turnkey or interactive map plotting; and built-in output of
summary information for the input database.

.LP
Default macros
can be established for an entire installation, and individual users
can modify these in part or in whole to suit their needs. Users can also set up
their own macros, without affecting the installation-wide defaults. New
macros can be defined in \fBmapset\fP and saved directly from the program by
choosing "save as" under the "macros" pull-down menu.
.LP
Mapset allows both pre-set map labels and pre-set boilerplates to be
specified in files that can be referenced either in macros or dynamically
within the program. The "Label files" and "Boilerplate files" widgets in the
\fBmapset\fP window are pull-down menus listing available label and boilerplate files.
The list boxes below them show which label and boilerplate files will
be used by dbmapevents.
Choosing items in the pull-down menus will insert them into the lists of label
and boilerplate files that will be used. Double-clicking on any entry
in the listboxes will remove the entry. These files can be constructed
automatically using dbmapevents in interactive mode.
.SH FILES
Mapset macros are specified by the suffix _mapset_macro.pf and are in datascope
parameter-file format.
Label files have the suffix .label, have a first line with the word "label", and
are filled with lines of the form
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf

        lat lon lat lon charsize 0text

.fi
.in
.ft R
Macro, Label, and Boilerplate files are currently stored in
/home/kent/work/\fBmapset\fP/data.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
PFPATH  describes the path(s) in which to find mapset macros. If this
variable is not set, it defaults to the current working directory. Filenames
occuring later on the search path will overwrite parameters that have been
read earlier in the search path from files of the same name. This
allows users to override certain default parameter settings.
user-owned versions of the default macros do not need to be complete--they can specify any few of
the parameters that the user wants to run differently from the defaults, as
long as the user's macro files are seen after the default macro files. If the
PFPATH variable does not contain ., . is appended to the end, allowing
current-working-directory macros to take precedence.
Sample syntax:
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf

        setenv PFPATH /home/kent/data/pf:.

.ft R
.LP
DBMAPEVENTS_DATA describes the path(s) in which to find boilerplate
and label files. If this variable is not set, it defaults to the
current working directory. The first file of a given name found is the
one that will be used.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
Macros are specified in parameter files with the suffix *_mapset_macro.pf.
Files for map labels are specified *.label. Files for boilerplates are
specified *.bp.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Currently you must run \fBmapset\fP in a directory in which you have write permission,
so it can create the dbmapevents.pf file that dbmapevents reads.
.LP
Mapset reads in the list of available label and boilerplate files only when it
first starts up. If you add new label or boilerplate files you have to restart
the program for them to show up (though if you save a new macro from \fBmapset\fP,
it will show up immediately).
.LP
Double-clicking on an empty label-file or boilerplate-file listbox produces
an error message.
.LP
Mapset will allow you to print out the map while you're still in interactive mode,
though since the map isn't finished yet the printout won't work
(there's no "showpage" yet in the dbmapevents.ps file).
Quit dbmapevents before printing if you started up in interactive mode.
.LP
The title specified in the \fBmapset\fP window will be used only if the
"use custom title" checkbutton is activated.
.LP
Once dbmapevents is started in interactive mode, further modification of the
map must be done from the xterm command window launched for dbmapevents,
not from the \fBmapset\fP window.
.LP
Adding new parameters requires lots of coding. The parameter
has to be added to:
.ft CW
.in 2c
.nf

the parameter file itself;
the get_params call in dbmapevents.F;
the get_params definition in get_params_.c, including declaration
  of the formal argument;
the \fBmapset\fP get_macro procedure (declared global...);
the \fBmapset\fP save_pf procedure;
the \fBmapset\fP gui (i.e. make a button or whatever for it).
This could be simplified.
