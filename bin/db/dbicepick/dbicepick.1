.SH NAME
dbicepick, gui_dbicepick \- utility for tuning picking parameters of icepick
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbicepick \fP-begin \fItime\fP -end \fItime\fP -db \fIdbname\fP \\[\fIexpr\fP\\]
\fBgui_dbicepick \fP\\[-begin \fItime\fP\\] \\[-end \fItime\fP\\] -db \fIdbname\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Dbicepick applies the Earthworm version of the Rex-Allen picking algorithm to waveform data in a
CSS database. Gui_dbicepick is a graphical front-end for dbicepick. A time-period may be specified,
as well as an expression describing a subset of stations to be picked.

The database specified must be in iceworm1.3 format and contain a picker table and waveforms. Usually
this is accomplished by creating a local copy of the picker table for modification (do not do
tuning experiments on the running system!!), then using the descriptor file to refer to the site database
and continuous waveform data.
