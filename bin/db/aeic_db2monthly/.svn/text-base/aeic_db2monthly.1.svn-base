.SH SYNOPSIS
db2monthly dbin minimim_mag 
.LP
where:
.LP
dbin = input database
.LP
minimum_mag =  Minimum magnitude threshold for highlights
.SH DESCRIPTION
db2monthly assumes that the input database includes a full month worth of earthquakes. Given a 
monthly database, db2monthly will generate a complete USGS style event listing
of events that meet the minimum magnitude criterion and one map of seismicity in Alaska. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "dbin"
The input dabase name. Assumed to be a monthly database. This argument is required.
.IP "minimum_mag"
The minimum earthquake magnitude to report in the highlights. This argument is required.
