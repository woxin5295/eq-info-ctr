.SH NAME
dbplotcov \- Make a plot and listing of waveform coverage from a database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbplotcov database sta:chan tstart tend [-h[scale]] [-wftar]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dbplotcov
reads the \fBwfdisc\fP table from the specified \fIdatabase\fP,
determines the periods of time for which waveform segments exist
for each station-channel and prints and plots this information.
A PostScript version of the coverage plot, named \fIdbplotcov.ps\fP,
is created in the current directory.
.LP
Only station channel pairs specified by the \fIsta:chan\fP
sift key are displayed.  To select all station channel pairs,
specify '*'.  Otherwise, specify a comma separated list, each element
of which is one pair.  Either sta or chan may be '*' to select all
possibilities, or either may be specified using UNIX regular expressions.
(see ed (1))
.LP
Examples:
.IP 'AAK:BHZ,KKL:HHZ'
.br
station AAK, channel BHZ, and station KKL, channel HHZ
.IP 'AAK:*'
.br
all channels for station AAK
.IP '*:HHZ'
.br
all stations with channel HHZ
.IP 'A..:..Z'
.br
all 3 character stations starting with 'A' with channels ending in 'Z'
.LP
Note that the shell attempts to expand strings which contain *,
so this argument must usually be placed between single quotes.
.LP
The starting time \fItstart\fP and ending time \fItend\fP
may be specified in any of the formats described in str2epoch(3).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -nodisplay The program will generate a postscript file only, without
attempting to connect to an X-windows display.
.IP "-h [scale]"
.br
For triggered data, a plot of data availability is less useful, so
this option plots a bar for each day, with the height of the
bar indicating the number of triggers.  You may specify a maximum
value (scale) for the number of triggers; the default is 10.
.IP "-wftar"
The program will optionally read the wftar table rather than the
wfdisc table.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

Plot coverage charts may also be generated with these programs,
but these charts can not be printed.
