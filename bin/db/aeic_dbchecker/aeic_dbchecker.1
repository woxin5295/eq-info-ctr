.SH NAME
dbchecker \- Checks an orid in a database for possible errors.
.SH SYNOPSIS
dbchecker dbin orid
.LP
where:
.LP
dbin = input database
.LP
orid =  orid # of event to run dbchecker on
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbchecker is intended to assist the AEIC analyst in picking and
locating earthquakes by runing several checks on the database.
dbchecker is similar to checker, run from Xpick, however it is intended
to run on a Antelope Datascope database rather than a pickfile.
dbchecker assumes that the input database (dbin) includes at least
one earthquake. You must specify which event to check by giving its
orid on the command line. dbchecker will then check the event for
a number of possible errors and produce a report to the window from
which it was called.

The report dbchecker produces includes:
Origin time, location, geographic region and statistics;
standard error of the P and S picks; and seismic gap. It reports if 
number of P picks is less than 10 or S picks is less than 3. It lists 
stations with large travel time residuals. It checks for magnitude range 
and reports if it is larger than 1.5. It lists stations with magnitude 
residuals greater than 0.75. It checked location errors and flags events with smajax>=20 or sdepth>=30. This is intended to assist the analyst in 
locating problematic stations that may bias the magnitude. dbchecker 
also includes a check for multiple P and S picks at a single station 
and offers suggestions for additional stations to pick that may reduce 
the seismic gap and improve the location solution.

The input database name. This argument is required.
.IP "orid"

between the origin, origerr and stamag tables.
