      This function cross-correlates time series.

      sr:          sampling rate of the two series (not a whole number)
      laglen:      maximum amount (seconds) of offset for cross-correlation
                       laglen << npts/sr (laglen ~ 0.2 npts/sr is typical)
      tau:         signal time diff. (epoch seconds) of second - first
                   (This closely reflects the origin time difference.)
      ccc:         cross-correlation coefficient (-1 <= ccc <= 1)
