.SH NAME
dbcorrelate \- program to perform waveform cross-correlation
.SH DESCRIPTION
The first step before running this program should be running create_event_pairs program to identify event pairs to be cross-correlated. The next step is to identify phases for cross-correlation and compute the cross-correlations to get 
the estimated event time delays. The procedure for the next stop depends on the size of the 
database.  Due to the need to get information for event pairs from non-contiguous parts of the 
database, a large number of joins and subsets are required.  This becomes very inefficient as the 
database gets large, say if the hypocenter list has more than a couple hundred events.  It's an N-
squared type operation.  For instance, an origin table containing just 200 events can easily 
generate tens of thousands of possible correlation pairs.  An origin table with 2000 closely 
located events could generate millions of cross-correlations.  An alternative method is needed for 
larger databases, say > 1000 events.  For a small database, use Method A below.

.SH INPUT
.nf
 where the arguments are:

db - is the input database

flag - is a flag [0/1] which tells the program where to get the data, 
either in the main directory (0) or in the subdirectories (1).  
In this case, use flag = 0.  

winlen - is the length of waveform data, in seconds, to use for the cross-corrrelation. 
A value of 1 to 2 seconds is typically good.  The window is cut starting 0.1 seconds 
before the particular arrival time.  

laglen - is the lag, in seconds, for the correlation function computation, or how 
far one waveform will be shifted, both ways, relative to the other.  A value of 
0.2 to 0.3 seconds is desirable.   

cccmin - is a parameter to control the output size. Because station-event pairs 
for which the |ccc| is low (say, 0.7 or less) are probably not useful, it is 
reasonable to set this value to eliminate many of the CC results.  Note that the 
absolute value is used, so that "0.7" means all ccc ? -0.7 and ? +0.7 are saved.

inputfile - is the file created in running create_event_pairs program 
  
outputfile - is the name of the file to hold the output.  (For restarts, remove 
this file first because it is opened "append").

.SH OUTPUT
.nf

The output file contains the CC results, with these fields

sta   -- station code (for instance, DOM)
phase -- phase type (P or S; any others should be excluded if they appear)
orid1 -- orid for 1st event (local table number)
jdate1 -- jdate for 1st event
orid2 -- orid for 2nd event (local table number)
jdate2 -- jdate for 1st event
ccc   -- cross-correlation coefficient at the CC peak (-1 < ccc < 1)
cccp -- cross-variance coefficient at the CC peak, measuring the relative signal amplitude
tau  -- absolute time shift (seconds) between signals (t2 - t1) as given by the CC peak
otdiff-- difference in catalog origin times (ot2 - ot1) in seconds

.SH CAVEATS
This run will take awhile, on the order of hours if the number of events is in the hundreds. Different methods is recommended to be used for large databases. Read original dbcorrelate documentaiton file on the details.
