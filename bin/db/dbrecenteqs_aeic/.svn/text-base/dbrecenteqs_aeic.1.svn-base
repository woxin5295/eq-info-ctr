.SH NAME
.nf
dbrecenteqs_aeic - maintain a web site showing recent earthquakes, using AEIC extensions to dbrecenteqs
.fi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
dbrecenteqs_aeic [-p pffile] [-v] [-h] [-u] [-e evid] [-c sourcedb] [-o] dbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbrecenteqs_aeic\fP incorporates all of the functionality of dbrecenteqs version 4.6. However, AEIC has added some extensions.
.LP
The basis for \fBdbrecenteqs_aeic\fP
is BRTT's 4.6 release of dbrecenteqs. Modifications by AEIC staff including Josh Stacnik and Glenn Thompson have been made to tailor the program. For example, filtering has been added to allow dbrecenteqs_aeic to show a subset of the events available in the database. A switch has also been only just to show prefors, rather than all origins for an event, on the webpage.
.SH OPTIONS
These are identical to dbevents, except for the addition of:
.IP "-o"
If this is specified, then the webpage generated for each event will show only the prefor (preferred origin) rather than all origins. Think of -o as meaning "only prefors".
.SH "PARAMETER FILE"
All program parameters defined in the Antelope 4.6 version of the
\fBdbrecenteqs\fP parameter file are supported. Added parameters include:
.IP inputdb_subset
An expression can be entered here, for example to filter the input database based on a geographical filter, e.g.:
	inputdb_subset		(lat>49 && lat<72) && (lon<-130 || lon>165)
.IP inputdb_delete
To permanently delete bad events (rather than filter them from the display), an expression can be entered here, e.g.:
	inputdb_delete	 	nass<10 && (ml>=3.5 || mb>=3.5)
.SH BUGS AND CAVEATS
* dbrecenteqs_aeic has not yet been tested
* It is based on Antelope 4.6. There may be conflicts with Antelope 4.9. It would be better to merge the AEIC code from 4.6 into the 4.9 version of dbrecenteqs.
