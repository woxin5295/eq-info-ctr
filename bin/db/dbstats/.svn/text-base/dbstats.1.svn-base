.SH NAME
dbstats \- calculates magnitude and travel time station statistics and generates corresponding lists and figures.
.SH SYNOPSIS
dbstats dbin 
.LP
where:
.LP
dbin = input database
.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a css earthquake database, dbstats will calculate travel time and magnitude residuals and standard deviations for each station from the site table. It will generate two files with the travel time and magnitude residuals, respectively, and the figures showing the average residuals with the standard deviations. Each figure plots 50 stations, for up to 500 stations total. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "dbin"
The input dabase name. Assumed to be a CSS database. This argument is required.
.SH FILES
dbstats generates flat files with the calculated statistics and the figures. Flat files include
a listing of stations with average residuals, minimum and maximum values, standard deviations, and the number of observations. The file names are stat.ttres (travel time statistics) and stat.magres (magnitude statistics). These files are ASCII format. The number of figures depends on the number of stations with observations. Each figure contains a maximum of 50 stations. The file names are stat_ttres[0-9].ps (travel time residuals) and stat_magres[0-9].ps (magnitude residuals). The figures are PostScript format.

dbstats will also generate a file of errors detected (dbstats.err).

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Requires $ANTELOPE environment.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Statistics is calculated only for the stations with "offdate == -1" in the site table. Maximum number of stations is 500 with the maximum number of plots of 10 for both the magnitude and the travel time statistics. All figures appear in the same niceplot window, each consequent figure overwrites the previous one. Y-axis of the plots are from -1 to 1 only.
