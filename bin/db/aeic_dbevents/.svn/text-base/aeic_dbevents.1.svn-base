.SH NAME
aeic_dbevents - Display seismic events and waveforms, AEIC version
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBaeic_dbevents \fP\fIdbname\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaeic_dbevents\fP displays events from the Datascope database \fIdbname\fP
in near real time on user defined maps. Waveforms may also be displayed;
the user interactively selects events to
display.  Waveforms are automatically ordered by distance,
time aligned to the first predicted P-arrival and filtered.
.LP
\fBaeic_dbevents\fP
polls the input database to see if the event or origin tables have
been modified since the last update and automatically updates
the display to reflect the current state of the database.
.SH "PARAMETER FILE"
Program parameters are specified in the
\fBaeic_dbevents\fP parameter file, aeic_dbevents.pf.
A brief description of each parameter follows.
.IP maxmapwidth
The maximum width of the map in pixels.
.IP maxmapheight
The maximum height of the map in pixels.
Maps of greater dimensions are scrolled into
a maxmapwidth by maxmapheight viewport.
.IP dbpickgeom
The initial geometry of the dbpick(1) waveform
display window (in <width>x<height>+<x>+<x> format).
.IP dbpicktypeingeom
The initial geometry of the dbpick command typein
window (in <width>x<height>+<x>+<x> format).
.IP scsift
The station-channel dbpick-style regular expression
sifter for displaying waveform channels
.IP channels
The number of waveform channels to show (before scrolling).
.IP twin
The waveform display time window (in seconds).
.IP filter
The waveform display filter index.
.IP textwidth
The width of the event text display (in characters).
.IP startdbpick
A boolean that indicates if the waveform display
is to be automatically enabled at startup.
.IP automap
A boolean that indicates if the map should
automatically page according to the location
of the selected event.
.IP legendon
A boolean that indicates if the map legend
should be displayed.
.IP external_catalog_authors
An associative array that describes the "known"
database author names of externally associated
origins and their associated
single letter codes for display in the text
display.
.IP local_catalog_authors
An associative array that describes the "known"
database author names of origins determined
by local analysts and their associated
single letter codes for display in the text
display.
.IP update_intervals
A table of update intervals that
is used in the Maps->Map_Update pulldown
menu to define the allowable update intervals.
Each interval can be of form <number><unit>,
where <number> is a number and <unit> is one
of "s", for seconds, "m", for minutes, "h",
for hours, or "d" for days (e.g. 5m for five
minutes).
.IP update_interval
One of the update_intervals values that is
used to set the initial update interval.
.IP symbol_colors
A table that describes the age vs. color
relation for plotting event symbols.
Each table entry contains an age (in the same format
as the update intervals) followed by two color
values, the first for unselected events and the
second for the selected event. The age of the
last entry is ignored and assumed to be infinity.
.IP maps
An associative array that defines the map pages
that can be displayed. Each map consists of
a name and an associative array that defines
the map parameters for each map.
.LP
Maps are defined by external image files along with
the parameters for each map. Currently, \fBaeic_dbevents\fP
supports Mercator and Equal-Distance projections.
The supported map image file formats are those
that are supported by the Tk image->photo
widget (GIF and PPM). The map parameters common
to all projections are as follows.
.IP file
The file name of the map image file.
.IP format
The map image file format ("gif" or "ppm").
.IP proj
The map projection ("merc" or "edp").
.IP palette
The internal tk color palette in the format <r>/<g>/<b>,
where <r> is the number of red values, <g> is the
number of green values and <b> is the number of
blue values. Tk8.0 reads the map as a 24-bit true-color
image and projects the image into the
color space defined by palette. This keeps the maps
from hogging the available color allocations for
8-bit devices.
.IP latminbb
A minimum latitude value for defining a map bounding box.
.IP latmaxbb
A maximum latitude value for defining a map bounding box.
.IP lonminbb
A minimum longitude value for defining a map bounding box.
.IP lonmaxbb
A maximum longitude value for defining a map bounding box.
.IP priority
A priority value that is used in conjunction with the
bounding box that defines which map to display when the
automap option is enabled. The selected event is first
compared against each of the map bounding boxes. If
more than one map bounds the event, then the map with the
highest priority wins.
.IP symsiz
The event symbol size (in pixels).
.LP
The projection dependent map parameters define the
transformation between map pixels and physical
latitude and longitude, so that the vents can be
accurately plotted over the map images. Following
are the map projection parameters for Equal-Distance
projection (edp) maps.
.IP latc
The reference latitude in degrees that defines the
zero distance point.
.IP lonc
The reference longitude in degrees that defines the
zero distance point.
.IP xdelmin
The X (east-west) distance from the reference in degrees
at the left edge of the map.
.IP xdelmax
The X (east-west) distance from the reference in degrees
at the right edge of the map.
.IP ydelmin
The Y (north-south) distance from the reference in degrees
at the top edge of the map.
.IP ydelmax
The Y (north-south) distance from the reference in degrees
at the bottom edge of the map.
.LP
Following are the map projection parameters for Mercator
projection (merc) maps.
.IP latmin
The latitude in degrees at the bottom edge of the map.
.IP latmax
The latitude in degrees at the top edge of the map.
.IP lonmin
The longitude in degrees at the left edge of the map.
.IP lonmax
The longitude in degrees at the right edge of the map.
.SH BUGS AND CAVEATS
The underlying pixmap routines support 8-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit
color only.
