.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcreate_event_pairs\fP creates event pairs for dbcorrelate program. Unless the source region is very small, it is not reasonable that every event be cross-correlated with every other.  When event separations become larger than 1/5 to 1/10 the station distance, they will likely have correlation coefficients for matching waveforms that are statistically not different that zero.  Thus a means of limiting the correlations to pairs of events where the 
separations are small is needed.  The following program operates on the database just created to identify these event pairs.
.SH INPUT
.nf
 where the arguments are:

db - is the database name in the local directory 

xtol, ytol, ztol - are the tolerances to use for hypocenter differences between event pairs. Normally the z tolerance should be largest to allow for the fact that depth is the least certain dimension of the hypocenter solution. 
 
maxlinks - limits the number of events with which any given event can be paired.  This prevents over-determining the event relative locations and can immensely save on the amount of computational time when events are closely packed in space (computational time savings of one or two orders of magnitude).

outputfile - is the name of the file to hold the event pairs

.fi
.SH OUTPUT
.nf
 file that holds the event pairs
