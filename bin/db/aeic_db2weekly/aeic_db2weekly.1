.SH NAME
db2weekly \-  generates the lists and figures used in the AEIC weekly report.
.SH SYNOPSIS
db2weekly dbin minimim_mag 
.LP
where:
.LP
dbin = input database
.LP
minimum_mag =  Minimum magnitude threshold for highlights
.SH DESCRIPTION
db2weekly assumes that the input database includes a full weeks worth of earthquakes. Given a 
weekly database, db2weekly will generate a complete USGS style event listing, brief descriptions
of all events that meet the minimum magnitude criterion and two maps of seismicity in Alaska. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "dbin"
The input dabase name. Assumed to be a weekly database. This argument is required.
.IP "minimum_mag"
The minimum earthquake magnitude to report in the highlights. This argument is required.
.SH FILES
db2weekly generates the lists and figures used in the AEIC weekly report. Output files include
a complete listing of all events in the weekly database (weekly_list), brief descriptions of
all events that exceed the minimum manitude (weekly_highlights), a map of Alaska with all events
in the weekly database (weekly_fig1.ps) and a map of events in south central Alaska (weekly_fig2.ps).
The files weekly_list and weekly_highlights are ASCII format. The maps weekly_fig1.ps and weekly_fig2.ps
are PostScript format.

db2weekly will also generate a file of errors detected in the input weekly database (db2weekly.err).

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The total number of events for the southcentral map was being calculated incorrectly in ak_dbmapevents. To fix this problem a subset database for the southcentral region is saved in a separate database (southcentral.origin, southcentral.event). (N.R.)
