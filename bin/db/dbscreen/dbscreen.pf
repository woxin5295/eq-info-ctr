Minimum_associated	3	# minimum number of stations with consistent arrivals
Average_velocity     ttimes	# used to calculate maximum time difference between stations
				# set to ttimes to use ttimes for calculation instead.
epsilon_t		1	# time to add to calculated maximum arrival time 
fudge_factor		1.001   # the criterion is
				#     ( delta_t + epsilon_t ) * fudge_factor
				#   where delta_t is calculated with ttimes or the specified
				#   average velocity.
Earth_radius	     6400000	# radius of earth in same system of units as average velocity
