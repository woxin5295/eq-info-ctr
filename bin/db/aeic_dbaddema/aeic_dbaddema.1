.SH SYNOPSIS
aeic_dbaddema dbin
.LP
where:
.LP
dbin = input database
.SH DESCRIPTION
aeic_dbaddema computes angle of emergence for each arrival in input database and writes into field ema of table arrival of CSS database. Two velocity models are used depending on location of the earthquake: scak and northak south and north of 62.5N, respectively. The program is intended to be used before dbfpfit to fill in missing angle of emergence values.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "dbin"
The input database name. This argument is required.

Example of the program output:

asperity:natasha 110 tcsh>> aeic_dbaddema db_tmp
 orid =   1, lat =     61.3606, depth =     47.2140
   103 arrivals for orid:   1
 Computing emas for orid:   1
 MODLIN: Using scak model
  
 orid =   2, lat =     63.6361, depth =     124.527
   89 arrivals for orid:   2
 Computing emas for orid:   2
 MODLIN: Using northak model
