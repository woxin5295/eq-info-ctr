.SH NAME
dbfpfit \- calculates double-couple fault plane solutions from p-wave first motions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbfpfit\fP [-o orid] \fIdbin files_out\fP
.LP
where:
.LP
orid - origin id of event for which the mechanism will be calculated
dbin - input CSS database. this argument is required.
files_out - root name of the output files. this argument is required.
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbfpfit would calculate a double-couple fault plane solution from p-wave first motions for up to 2000 events. If orid is specified in the command line, then focal mechanism is calculated only for this event. It supports a composite run, when a focal mechanism is calculated for all arrivals in the database. The search algorithm is that of fpfit (see Reasenberg, P.  and Oppenheimer, D.,  fpfit, fpplot and fppage: fortran computer programs for calculating and displaying earthquake fault-plane solutions, U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 85-739). dbfpfit uses different observation weighting scheme. Weighting options are given in the parameter file.
.SH OPTIONS
\fB-o \fP focal mechanism is calculated only for the event with this orid
.SH FILES
input files: CSS database and parameter file (dbfpfit.pf)
.LP
dbfpfit requires origin, arrival and assoc tables to be present
.LP
output files:
root.ray - this file is used bt fpplot program to plot focal mechanism and output search parameters
root.extsum - list of events used in composite run
root.out - error log and information on run
dbin.fplane - css fplane table with calculated focal mechanism parameters
.SH ENVIRONMENT
dbfpfit expects the ANTELOPE environment variable to be set correctly.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
Parameter file dpfpfit.pf

.SH EXAMPLE
asperity:natasha 215 tcsh>> dbfpfit -o 1 dbtest2 out2
 Welcome to dbfpfit!  This version of fpfit finds the
 best focal mechanism, and the distribution of p and t
 axes of solutions that are "almost" as good.
 Opened parameter file.
  opened /usr/local/aeic/5.2-64/data/fpfit_lahr/ptm10.dat  for read on unit: 11
  opened out2.ray  for write on unit:  3
  opened out2.extsum  for write on unit:  4
  opened out2.out  for write on unit:  8
  
  Reading in control parameters from parameter file.
 Quality weights will not be used
 Number of reversed stations -   0
 Number of ignored stations -   0

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Restricted search is no longer an option, as well as azimuthal and angle of incidence weighting options. If distances, azimuths, or angles of incidence are missing in arrival and/or assoc table, dbfpfit will not fill them in and will not use first motions with those parameters missing.
