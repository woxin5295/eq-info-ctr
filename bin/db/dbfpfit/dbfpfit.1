.SH NAME
\fBdbfpfit\fB \- calculates double-couple fault plane solutions from P-wave first motions
.SH SYNOPSIS
dbfpfit [-o orid] dbin file_out.ray
.LP
where:
.LP
dbin = input database. This argument is required.
.LP
file_out.ray = output ray file used by fpplot program. This argument is required.

.SH OPTIONS
-o  - orid number for databases with multiple origins, optional. If there is only one origin, that origin will be used. In case of multiple origins, focal mechanisms will be calculated for all.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbfpfit\fB is modification of fpfit program. It reads earthquake parameters and first motions from a css database, calculates focal mechanism(s) and writes fpplane table with the final solution(s). Required tables: origin, arrival, assoc. \fBdbfpfit\fB assigns weight to observations based on distance, and/or signal-to-noise ratio, and/or quality of pick (deltim parameter). These options are controled by parameter file. 
It is intended to assist in calculating P-wave first motion focal mechanisms.

.SH FILES
Output files:
.LP
1. fplane table.
.LP
2. an ascii file (ray) consisting, for each earthquake, of the hypo71 extended summary card, followed by neighboring solutions (within 90% confidence limits), followed by individual p-phase information, on logical unit punit (=3). This file serves as input to programs \fBfpplot\fB and \fBfppage\fB.
.LP
3. an ascii file (out) describing any errors in the control file, hypo71 file, presence of multiple mechanisms, a summary of polarity discrepancies by station and reading quality, and the distribution of strike, dip, and rake uncertainties on logical unit eunit.  


.SH PARAMETER FILE
It expects dbfpfit.pf parameter file

 Welcome to dbfpfit!  This version of fpfit finds the
 best focal mechanism, and the distribution of p and t
 axes of solutions that are "almost" as good.
