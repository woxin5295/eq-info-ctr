Attribute alarm_peak
        Real (12)
		Format ( "%12.3f" )
		Description ( "second measured value on a waveform" )
		Detail {
			This is a measured value on a waveform. The interpretation
			and units depend on the type of measurement.
		}

Attribute alarm_state
        String (35)
        Format ( "%-35s" )
        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "alarm status" )
        Detail {
		This is a prescribed string which names the type of alarm
		during the period between time and endtime. For example,
		low, medium, or high could relate to 
		different thresholds of peak waveform measurements and 
		sta_maintenance, sta_down, or sta_temphigh could represent 
		other criteria to take notice.

Attribute alarm_time
        Time (17)

        Units ( "Seconds" )
        Description ( "epoch time" )
        Detail {
		The actual time of the alarm. For detections, this is the actual
		time of the detection. For waveform measurements, this is the 
		sample time of the corresponding measurement.

        Detail {
                This relation provides a holder for the state of alarm for a 
                particular station. These alarms can originate from a variety of
		sources including waveform measurements, system diagnostics, etc.
		The alarm_time field in this relation corresponds to the actual time
	 	that the alarm occurred. time and alarm_time may be the same in
		many instances. If endtime is the null value, then alarm_state 
		likely represents the current station status.
