I had to fix a few things in stuff_iw_tracebuf.c, hence 
"mystuff_iw_tracebuf.c". I've used iceworm packets for convenience. Dan and
I talked about the desirability of having a "generic raw" format for 
orbpackets, which would be some kind of direct mapping from the "Generic
unstuffed orb packets." This would be similar to Dan's ORBDBUG packets,
I guess, though he suggested I not use those. Perhaps now he's fixed
what he needed to in those debug routines. Still, a generic raw format
seems to be a useful thing. 

CTFrame2orbpkts.c:
	freepkt and freepktchan may deserve to go into
	some widely available library, unless
	they already exist somewhere...

CTFrame2orbpkts expects the CTFrame to start at the beginning of the header shown in 
Detail A of the CT-Frame Data Format figure (figure 21)
get_next_block returns a CTFrame plus the preceding two
idle-bits, which in our case should probably be used to recognize the 
frame, rather than using length as we did.

get_next_block risks the occurence of a five-byte string in the data, i.e.
the two idle bits plus the address, control, siteid triplet. As above--should have
used the idle bits to decide on block length and parsing
