.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
watch_for_deletes [-p parameter_file] database xferdir

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwatch_for_deletes\fP should be run as an rtexec cronjob on an iMac. It is designed to monitor xferdir for delete messages and then call delete_event to delete an event so it doesn't show up in dbevents_aeic. 

\fBwatch_for_deletes\fP is smart enough to work out whether the delete message refers to an event time or an event id, and call delete_event in the appropriate manner.
