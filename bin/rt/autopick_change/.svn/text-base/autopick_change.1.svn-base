autopick_change \- Modify automatic picker table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBautopick_change \fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBautopick_change\fP program creates a graphical user interface to
change which stations are being picked by the iceworm system. Autopick_change
modifies the picker table in the Iceworm database, toggling picking
on or off for each available station. The \fBautopick_change\fP can also
entirely remove a row from the picker table.

The databases affected by \fBautopick_change\fP are listed in the aeic_rtsys
parameter file. If there is more than one database present, the databases
may be linked, such that the window displays stations for the primary
system's database, but attempts are made to apply the specified changes
to all available databases. A set of buttons at lower left choose which
database(s) are changed by \fBautopick_change\fP.

At lower right the button "Revert to last saved" allows the database
status to be restored to the condition at the time \fBautopick_change\fP
was started. If "all systems" option is selected, this reversion
applies to all the databases. Otherwise, it is applied only to the
active database.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
At the time of this writing, the icepick(1) module does not monitor
the site database for changes. Therefore, the icepick module must
be restarted in order for any changes to take effect.
