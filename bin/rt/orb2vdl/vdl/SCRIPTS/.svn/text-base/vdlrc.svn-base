#	Define VDL environment.  VDL_DIR points to the directory for vdl.  THis 
#	directory would have the executable images, and SCRIPTS/PARMS
#
#	VDL_STATION is the unique name appended to vdlmom.setup?? etc with station
# 	specific data.  Note the files are case sensitive so "BLO" means files are
#	vdlmom.setupBLO
#
#	For stations with startup or other problems, VDL will not run if there
#	is a file translated from VDL_LOCK
#
#	PSVDL is the best way to run ps on this system it is often "
#	/usr/bin/ps -A
#	/usr/bin/ps -aux
#	/usr/bin/ps -a
