.SH NAME
win2orb \- Acquire Japanese WIN-format data onto an orb
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
win2orb \[-v\] \[-V\] \[-p pfname\] \[-u port\] orbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The win2orb program acquires data in Japanese WIN format, converting 
the packets to orb packets and placing them on the specified orb. 

WIN packets are read from a UDP port. 
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
-p pffile allows a parameter-file to be specified (default is win2orb.pf)
-u port Specify UDP port number from which to accept WIN packets
-v verbose
-V really verbose
.fi
.SH FILES
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The SITE_DB environment variable is required, specifying the pathname to 
an iceworm1.3 site database. This database must contain the win table, 
which translates WIN station-codes into sta/chan/net. The database must
also contain a calibration table with entries for the stations to be 
reformatted. The database may optionally contain a timecorr table, in which 
case the specified communication delays will be applied to adjust packet start times. 
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The win2orb.pf parameter file specifies the assignment of the segtype
specification to the packets. Also, the timecorr boolean specifies whether 
to apply time corrections from the timecorr table of the iceworm1.3 schema.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Right now the only input-format supported is the UDP-packet mechanism. However, 
the specification of the UDP port is left as an option to support possible future 
enhancement of win2orb to connect directly to the Japanese shared-memory system. 

The win2orb program currently ignores byte-swapping issues. Sun byte-order (the 
standard for WIN format) is assumed.
