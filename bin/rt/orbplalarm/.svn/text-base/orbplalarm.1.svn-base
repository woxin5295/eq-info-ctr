.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBorbplalarm\fP monitors waveforms detections and measurements from /db/ packets
on an ORB and produces /db/plalarm rows based on threshold levels as described in
the parameter file. \fBorbplalarm\fP is designed such that the \fIplalarm\fP table 
represents a snapshot of the current status of stations being monitored. Any row in this
table that has an undefined \fIendtime\fP has an open alarm defined in the field \fIalarm_state\fP.
An alarm sequence begins with a detection state of D and ends once a detection state of OFF is reached for a 
particular station. This requires that the \fIorbdetect(1)\fP process populating the ORB with 
/db/detection rows \fINOT\fP be running with the -onlypicks argument, which only creates /db/detection 
rows for the actual pick (D). Once the alarm has been triggered into \fIdetection\fP or \fID\fP mode,
/db/wfmeas packets are then monitored for peak values as created by \fBorbwfpeak(1)\fP. These reported
peak values are then compared to the threshold criteria described in the paramter file using
units_convert(3). It is necessary that the units of the waveform measurements are consistent with 
the \fIthreshold_units\fP parameter in the parameter file. The detection row of the \fIplalarm\fP 
table remains open until the OFF state has been reached, even when waveform measurement thresholds
are exceeded. This means that once ground acceleration exceeds the "low" threshold value, there will
be two open rows. One representing the detection ON state and another representing the current alarm
level based on waveform measurements. Additionally, \fBorbplalarm\fP is designed such that the 
highest \fIalarm_state\fP reached during an alarm sequence is the one reported as current until the 
detection turns OFF. If the \fIalarm_state\fP increases from low to medium, the \fIplalarm\fP row
for \fIalarm_state\fP low will receive an \fIendtime\fP that is identical to the \fIalarm_time\fP
for \fIalarm_state\fP medium. This \fIalarm_state\fP medium database row will not be given an 
\fIendtime\fP until either the detection turns OFF or the ground acceleration increases to a higher
level.

\fBorbplalarm\fP can also monitor \fI/db/wfmeas\fP rows continuously with proper use of the 
\fIuse_detection\fP parameter in the parameter file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-start {pktid|time|OLDEST}"
Where to position the ORB read pointer for the input
ORB waveform packets. If a \fIpktid\fP is given, then
the ORB read pointer is positioned to that \fIpktid\fP.
If a valid Antelope \fItime\fP string is given (see epoch(1)),
then the ORB read pointer is positioned to the first packet
with a \fItime\fP stamp after the specified \fItime\fP. If \fIOLDEST\fP
is given, then the read pointer is positioned to the oldest
ORB packet in the buffer. If this option is not specified,
then the read pointer is positioned to the next available
most recent packet.
.IP "-select select_expr"
This is a regular UNIX expression that is used as a select
key (see orbselect(3)) for reading input waveform packets from the input
ORB. If this option is not specified, the default expression is '/db/(detection|wfmeas)'.
.IP "-reject rexpr"
This is a regular UNIX expression that is used as a reject
key (see orbreject(3)) for reading input waveform packets from the input
ORB. If this option is not specified,
then no packet srcnames from the input ORB will be rejected.
.IP "-pf pfname"
Name of program parameter file. This argument is optional
and if not specified defaults to \fBorbplalarm\fP. Note that
the actual parameter file is named \fIpfname\fP.pf.
.IP "-v"
Verbose output flag.
.IP "-vv"
Really verbose output flag. Each packet reaped is print to STDOUT using \fIshowPkt\fP.
.IP "orbin"
This is the name of the input ORB that contains the /db/detection and
/db/wfmeas rows to be processed. This argument is required.
.IP "orbout"
The /db/plalarm packets are copied to the ORB with this name. If this argument is not
specified, then output ORB packets will be written to orbin. (2/5/07 orbout must still
be specified. FIX THIS.)
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The \fBorbplalarm\fP parameter file contains all of the information
necessary for specifying channels and filters for processing detections
and waveform measurements and producing /db/plalarm packets based on
prescribed thresholds. Following is an example \fBorbplalarm\fP parameter file.

The stations to be monitored by \fBorbplalarm\fP are defined in the \fIalarm_stations\fP array.
The keys for this array are the station names and the values are either strings that correspond
to keys in the \fIalarm_templates\fP array, or the explicit array template itself.
.IP "report_interval"
The status of all monitored stations can be reported to the log file every \fIreport_interval\fP
seconds. Set to 0 for no reporting.
.IP "use_detection"
Set to 1 to use detection-based alarms. Otherwise \fI/db/wfmeas\fP rows will be continuously 
monitored.
.IP "detection_subset"
.IP "wfmeas_subset"
This regular expression is applied to incoming database rows for a particular station.
.IP "units"
This is the units of the values in the \fIthresholds\fP table. These units must be compatible
with the \fIunits1\fP field of the \fI/db/wfmeas\fP row as defined by units_convert(3).
.IP "thresholds"
This list defines the thresholds at which alarms are defined. The string is reported in the 
\fIalarm_state\fP field of the plalarm table as the threshold value is exceeded.
.SH EXAMPLE
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Other than the obvious that it doesn't quite work perfectly yet...

This code may need multithreading in order to properly process the /db/wfmeas packets
once a detection occurs.

Currently, there isn't any statefile information used. This should likely be added 
along with a timeout variable to close out the event if a detection OFF is not
received.

The \fIthresholds\fP list in the alarm templates must be listed in ascending order.
