# This is a sample file with ideas for a new orbplalarm.pf parameter file

# if wfmeas_subset is blank, all wfmeas rows for the station are used. 
# Note that only some measurements 
# if detection_subset is blank, all detections (all channels, all filter bands) 
# for the station are used. 
# Note that proper interpretation of the threshold will require 
# internal use of the units_convert(3) function, as well as splitting 
# of the low/medium/high filter spec rows. 


# report all stations current alarm status to log 
# file every report_interval seconds. Set to 0 for
# no reporting.
