.SH NAME
run_orbtriggered_shakemap \- scaffold script to launch shakemap from rtexec
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
run_orbtriggered_shakemap [-1d] [-s seekposition] orbname shakemap_bindir
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The run_orbtriggered_shakemap script launches the USGS ShakeMap program
from within a running instance of the Antelope rtexec(1) utility. The orbname
specifies the orb from which to acquire /db/origin packets for 
located hypocenters. The shakemap_bindir argument gives the directory 
from which the ShakeMap program "shake" is to run (run_orbtriggered_shakemap
expects to find this command in said directory).  The event-id ("evid") 
from the database row is passed to shake via 
.nf

	shake -event <evid>
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -1
Only run one earthquake and then exit. Used for testing purposes. (the 
default is to run continuously on all incoming orb packets).
.IP -d
Run in debug mode, dumping each packet header.
.IP -s seekposition
orbseek to seekposition before beginning to reap packets. seekposition
can be any acceptable orbseek value, such as a pktid or ORBOLDEST, ORBCURRENT,
etc. default is ORBNEXT.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"

Due to limited error-trapping and major structural weaknesses, this 
script is absolutely not for operational use. It is only for 
testing and for scaffolding during system implementation. 

The sleep-time after an orb packet arrives and before the 
shakemap process is launched is hard-wired to 5 seconds. 

run_orbtriggered_shakemap expects that orb packets will already have the 
evid set correctly and identical to the one in the database ShakeMap is
querying.

In order to run this script under rtrun, it is necessary to add 
environment variable GS_LIB to the Env array in the appropriate 
rtexec.pf.
