.SH TIMECORR_CHANGE
timecorr_change \- Modify communications-delay database table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBtimecorr_change \fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtimecorr_change\fP program creates a graphical user interface to
change communication delays for the iceworm system. Timecorr_change
modifies the timecorr table in the Iceworm database.
 The timecorr_change can also
entirely remove a row from the timecorr table.

The databases affected by \fBtimecorr_change\fP are listed in the aeic_rtsys
parameter file. If there is more than one database present, the databases
may be linked, such that the window displays stations for the primary
system's database, but attempts are made to apply the specified changes
to all available databases. A set of buttons at lower left choose which
database(s) are changed by \fBtimecorr_change\fP.

At lower right the button "Revert to last saved" allows the database
status to be restored to the condition at the time \fBtimecorr_change\fP
was started. If "all systems" option is selected, this reversion
applies to all the databases. Otherwise, it is applied only to the
active database.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
New rows cannot be added to the databases with \fBtimecorr_change\fP. This
must be done with dbe or another program.
