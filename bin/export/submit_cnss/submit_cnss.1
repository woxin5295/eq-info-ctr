.SH NAME
submit_cnss \- submit cnss-format file of hypocenters to the CNSS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBsubmit_cnss \fP\fIYYYYMM\fP \fIcnss_file\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsubmit_cnss\fP is the Alaskan installation of Doug Neuhauser's script send.cnss.csh,
which takes a pre-constructed file called "\fIcnss_file\fP" of hypocenters in
the CNSS unified single-line format and submits said file to the CNSS
(Council of the National Seismic System). The script actually supports zero- and
one-argument runs, but only the specified two-argument form works for the
Alaskan version. \fIYYYYMM\fP is the year and month of the file to be submitted.
.LP
\fBsubmit_cnss\fP uses rsh or rcp to submit the catalog, which requires a .rhosts
entry at quake.geo.berkeley.edu. Currently the allowed accounts
are kent@nordic.giseis.alaska.edu, roger@nordic.giseis.alaska.edu, and
catalog@megathrust.giseis.alaska.edu.  Changes are currently made by
Doug Neuhauser, doug@seismo.berkeley.edu.
