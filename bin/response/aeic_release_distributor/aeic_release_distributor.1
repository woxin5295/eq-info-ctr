.SH NAME
aeic_release_distributor\- distribute information for AEIC release notices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBaeic_release_distributor \fP[\fInofangs\fP]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaeic_release_distributor\fP allows information to be distributed via
email and web during the AEIC information-release process. This
script is intended to be launched by a driver script. However, in
the event something has gone wrong, it may be launched from the directory
containing the information-release files, such as the text of the email
message and the documents to go on the web.

There is one GUI button for each info-distribution task. A row of
checkboxes at left marks which tasks have been completed. The buttons
are disabled when the task is completed, however if repetition of a task
is necessary, deactivation of the checkoff box will allow
re-activation of the button.

In the event one wishes to skip a step intentionally, checking off
the checkbox manually will suppress the "incomplete" warning at the
end without actually taking that distribution step.

The \fInofangs\fP option on the command line will allow the process to be
dry-run without the events taking place.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Clicking on an actual checkoff box will not trigger the event
to occur. One must click on the colored buttons themselves. The
checkoff boxes are intended for notetaking. This feature can
be used to suppress the warning of incompletion upon exit, if
a step is intentionally skipped.
